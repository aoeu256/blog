There is functools, itertools, operator, and contextlib to do functional programming in Python, but its not 100% ideal.  functools.partial and compose lets you do currying and compose, context managers, decorators, and iterators with yield can be used to simulate multiline lambdas.  Data classes can be used as ADTs and named tuples can be used for records for immutable data.  Multidispatch and predicate dispatch can be gotten with a library.  Static typing can be gotten with mypy.  There are pipe libraries that use hacks to let you treat aribitrary functions as infix so you can do f |compose| g or f |bind| g, but yes its a hack.  Although Python does not support overloading bind, assignment, and semicolon sys.set_trace and the with statement can be used to add logging and run code in between your code. （編集済み）
